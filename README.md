## Requirements and Prerequisites

This project requires Python 3.12.0 or a compatible version. Due to compatibility issues with `tensorflow` on Python 3.12.0, itâ€™s essential to first install and upgrade `setuptools` as follows:

1. **Install `setuptools`**: This package helps manage and resolve compatibility issues during package installations.
   
   ```bash
   pip install setuptools
   ```
2. Upgrade in case it's an older version

   ```
   pip install --upgrade setuptools
   ```
